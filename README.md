### Interconnected Realities: Exploring the Dynamics of Development, Environment, and Pollution

#### Data Visualization Project Report
**Theme:** Environment

**Motivation:**
In a rapidly changing world, understanding environmental challenges is crucial. Climate change, deforestation, and resource depletion necessitate effective tools for analysis. Data visualization offers insights by translating complex data into understandable visuals. Through this project, we aim to illuminate environmental dynamics, aiding informed decision-making and fostering appreciation for our natural world.

**Objective:**
Our objective is to discern insights within environmental factors like forest cover, rainfall, and air pollution. Key relationships to explore include the correlation between geographical area and green space, rainfall patterns and forest cover, impact of green areas on air pollution, and the balance between development and environmental costs.

**Datasets:**
Data has been sourced from data.gov.in, including state-wise tree cover, forest cover, rainfall, air pollution, and Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) data.

**Key Hypotheses:**
1. States with larger geographical areas have lower forest coverage.
2. Higher rainfall correlates with increased forest coverage.
3. High forest coverage correlates with lower air pollution levels.
4. High forest coverage correlates with lower GSDP.
5. States with higher GSDP experience heightened air pollution levels.

**Further Assessment:**
We'll evaluate if the environmental cost of progress is being mitigated through measures like increasing green areas.
